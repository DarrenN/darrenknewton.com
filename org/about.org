* Nice to meet you.

I'm a [[https://lisp-lang.org/][parenthesis enthusiast]] in New York City who co-founded [[https://paperswelove.org/][Papers We Love]] and it's [[https://pwlconf.org/][eponymous conference]] with [[https://github.com/zeeshanlakhani][Zeeshan Lakhani]]. You can find me on [[https://bsky.app/profile/drun.v25media.com][bsky]] and [[https://github.com/DarrenN/cl-echo][GitHub]].

This is more or less my online journal. Expect to find a lot of half-baked notes and notions. Nothing here should be used in production
