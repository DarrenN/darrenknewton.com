I'm a command line interface kind of guy, which is funny since I do everything on Macs. Then again, I first embraced PCs with an Apple IIe, which was a CLI only experience.

One little tool I've had installed for a while is [z](https://github.com/rupa/z) by [Rupa](https://github.com/rupa). It's a nice little shell script that keeps tabs on the directories you've been [cd](http://compute.cnr.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi?cd)ing in and out of and then lets you quickjump to them using a simple regex. So instead of remembering a long path like: READMORE

	:::bash
	$ cd /Users/shibuya/github/octopress

I can just do something like:

	:::bash
	$ z octo

If I have two directories with similar names, like `website_development` and `website_master` I can differentiate them like so:

	:::bash
	$ z web d 		# Will cd to /website_developement
	$ z web m 		# Will cd to /website_master

All in all it saves me quite a few keystrokes. Check out more examples in the [README](https://github.com/rupa/z/blob/master/README).
