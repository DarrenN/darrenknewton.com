If you're using nginx as your webserver and need to pass URL parameters to your PHP front controller then some adjustments to your configuration file are necessary: READMORE
    
    :::c
    location /www {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /www/index.php?$args;
    }

## The longer explanation:

I'm recenlty worked on a small PHP application built with [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) and served up with [nginx](http://www.nginx.org/). 
The application makes use of Twitter's API with OAuth 1.0 (which in my opinion is very difficult to use compared to Facebook's OAuth2 implementation.)

OAuth 1.0 requires GET/POSTing with urls like:

    :::text
    /www/twitter/auth?oauth_token=XXX&oauth_verifier=XXX

Everything was working fine on my laptop under Apache, but not when I moved it to my dev server under nginx. Some logging revealed that the URL parameters
were not getting picked up by Silex's `Request` class.

I took a look at my `nginx.conf` and found the culprit, the redirect to the front controller was setup like so:

    :::c
    location /www {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /www/index.php;
    }

This doesn't pass any URL parameters to `index.php`, so I simply added `?$args` to the redirect:

    :::c
    location /www {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /www/index.php?$args;
    }

and **booya!** everything is working again.
