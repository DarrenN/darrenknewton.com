### Howdy!

My name is Darren Newton. Writing about myself is always awkward so I'll keep this fairly brief.

I'm from [Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston). I started teaching myself to program in [Apple Basic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_BASIC) hacking apart [BBS software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networks_II) in the days of Apple Cat modems. I rode a [skateboard](http://memoryscreened.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/dsc_7610.jpg) and went to [Art](http://www.art.uh.edu/) [School](http://www.saic.edu/).

I currently live in Brooklyn, New York. I've been working as an interactive designer and front/back-end developer since 2000. [You can read my public resume on LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/darrennewton). More importantly, you can [check out some of my code on Github](https://github.com/DarrenN) and [my questions/answers on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/12799/darren-newton).

You can [view my design portfolio over on v25media.com](http://v25media.com) and also at [my current employer's site](http://gabardine.com).

I love good design, and good code, and twisting my noodle on problems in general. I also maintain a few servers and muck about with server configurations (nginx/apache) and that sort of thing. Yeah, Renaissance Man, that's me.
