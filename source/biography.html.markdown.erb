My name is <span itemprop="name">Darren Newton</span>.

I'm from [Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston). As a kid I taught myself to program with [Apple Basic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_BASIC) by hacking apart [BBS software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networks_II) in the days of Apple Cat modems. I rode a [skateboard](http://memoryscreened.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/dsc_7610.jpg) and went to [Art](http://www.art.uh.edu/) [School](http://www.saic.edu/).

I currently live in Brooklyn, New York. I've been working as a developer/designer since 2000. You can read my [resume](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/darrennewton) if you
want. More importantly, you can check out some of my [code](https://github.com/DarrenN) on Github and [my questions/answers](http://stackoverflow.com/users/12799/darren-newton) on Stack Overflow.

My design portfolio is available over on [v25media.com](http://v25media.com).

Besides long walks on the beach, I'm a parenthesis enthusiast and enjoy hacking on Racket and Clojure along with deep diversions into Alt-JavaScript languages.
