A while back on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2564099) [edw519](http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=edw519) (Ed Weissman) posted his collection of tips and advice for programmers.

### It was amazing stuff.

His [original post](http://edweissman.com/53640595) didn't have much in the way of formatting, so using a series of regexes I made a slightly more styled version with links to sections and formatted code which I posted on the Hacker News thread. Mr. Weissman didn't seem to mind, and made note of some places where I had munged his formatting a little (which I promptly corrected.)

I stumbled across that file this morning while cleaning up one of my servers and decided to re-post the link for posterity's sake: [http://static.v25media.com/edw519_mod.html](http://static.v25media.com/edw519_mod.html). It is loaded with gems for folks making a living or seeking to make a living as a programmer. _I highly suggest reading it._

The reason you're not passionate about your work is because something is missing. Identifying what is missing is your first step in determining where to go from here.
