My fellow worker bees over at [Gabardine.com](http://gabardine.com) decided to flex their design chops by lending a hand to the folks downtown at Liberty Square. While Occupy Wall Street gives us a much needed civics lesson, and the 1% continues to skim the cream off your bank accounts, [Scott Grant](http://gabardine.com/is/scott-grant) took some of the DIY signs from the occupation and re-made them as snappy posters.
