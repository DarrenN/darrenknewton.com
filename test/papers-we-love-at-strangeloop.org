[[https://youtu.be/suv76aL0NrA?si=VN4w3uRMV7k0PhiI][Strange Loop]] has ended. I say it out loud and realize I won't be flying into St. Louis next September. It's absence is palpable for now, but this will soften with time. What comes next is already a topic of discussion across newly fragmented social meadia platforms.

It's easy to talk about Strange Loop as a monolithic community. In reality it encompassed many different niche communities, cliques, and communal ideas. If you talked to five different attendees each would describe a completely different conference than what you just experienced. This is also what made Strange Loop special, the ability to choose your own conference, find your own affinity groups within the bigger gathering.

Alex Miller, Strange Loop's creator, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loNeu5Yrazs][recently mentioned]] that the conference happened at the "just the right time". It brought together a lot different ideas about computers and software that were floating around in meetups and online forums. I think this is the important point folks should consider when thinking about "what comes after Strange Loop". Don't try to emulate what was, try to identify interesting strands of ideas floating around now and build on those.


It got so big that the Pre-Conference Program of years past became a thriving ecosystem of it's own. It certainly did for [[https://paperswelove.org/][Papers We Love]], providing a home for our yearly [[https://pwlconf.org/][conference]] and then allowing us to "graduate" into a Strange Loop track proper for this final year.

I recently had the opportunity to participate in an [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loNeu5Yrazs][episode of the Causal Islands podcast]] with [[https://github.com/puredanger][Alex Miller]], [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeeshanlakhani/][Zeeshan Lakhani]], [[https://www.deltamualpha.org/][David Ashby]], and [[https://cemerick.com/][Chas Emerick]] about both Strange Loop and Papers We Love.



There is a finality in saying it, and it's been sinking in that I won't be making my regular flight to St. Louis next September. I didn't know it at the time, but landing in Missouri for the [[https://thestrangeloop.com/2013/sessions.html][2013 edition]] of the conference would have a profound impact on my career in software. Running meetups and conferences was the furthest thing from my mind, but a decade later I'm pondering the future of both.

I've been talking to a lot of people about how [[https://paperswelove.org/][Papers We Love]] got started and how we became a part of [[https://thestrangeloop.com/2016/pwlconf.html][Strange Loop]]. You can hear an oral history with Zeeshan Lakhani and Alex Miller in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loNeu5Yrazs][Episode 2]] of the Causal Islands Podcast. It seemed like a good time to write some of these stories down, because maybe they'll point us to something new.

* Serendipity

Sometimes you're just in the right place at the right time with the right people. Things click. Ideas bounce around and off in odd directions. Around 2010 new languages were popping up everywhere. Clojure was the hot new thing and putting Lisp back into conversation. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOdoCqoqXlU][David Nolen]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Sg04IEkvk][Jeremy Ashkenas]] were doing meetups at the New York Times about ClojureScript and CoffeeScript. Computers were fun! You didn't need a PhD to create languages! Seize the means of production!

In 2013 I was working at a small web agency in New York City with [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeeshanlakhani/][Zeeshan Lakhani]], [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/haroldclintonnewsom/][Clint Newsom]], [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-olsen-1167381b/][Stephen Olsen]], [[https://www.deltamualpha.org/][David Ashby]], and [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyheiler/][Jeremy Heiler]]. Zeeshan and Clint convinced me to go to Strange Loop in 2013 after having their minds blown in [[https://thestrangeloop.com/2012/sessions.html][2012]]. I remember sitting in a mind-expanding talk by [[https://thestrangeloop.com/2013/a-relational-exploration-of-the-chomsky-hierarchy.html][Dan Friedman and Will Byrd]] on the Chomsky Hierarchy and Rich Hickey's talk on [[https://thestrangeloop.com/2013/clojure-core-dot-async.html][core.async]]. I barely understood the first and was very intrigued by the second. [[https://thestrangeloop.com/2013/functional-reactive-programming-in-elm.html][Evan Czaplicki]] did one of his early Elm talks and Gary Bernhardt dropped the [[https://thestrangeloop.com/2013/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript.html][Birth and Death of JavaScript]]. Let's just say it was not only a good time, but a hell of a ride too.

* A meetup is born

Six months later, riding off the energy and ideas picked up at Strange Loop, our little clique took a chance and [[https://paperswelove.org/][Papers We Love]] was born in New York City. The premise was very simple. A lot of our group came from non-traditional backgrounds, lacking Computer Science degrees. We were "very into computers" and wanted a deeper understanding of languages, databases, distributed systems, garbage collectors, you name it. We tried and failed to get a reading group going at work, so Clint floated the idea of starting a meetup to pull in like minded individuals to see what happens.

Our first speaker was [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtUtfARSIv8][Michael Bernstein]] with a talk on [[https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2019fa/blog/unified-theory-gc/][A Unified Theory of Garbage Collection]]. I think around 40 people showed up, which was a bit of a surprise. As soon as we dropped it on Twitter it blew up. [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/inessombra/][Ines Sombra]] and [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/elainegreenberg/][Elaine Greenberg]] quickly reached out asking if they could do one in San Francisco, which immediately got a thumbs up from us.

A month later San Francisco ran their first meetup with [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya9X63VPgV8][Ryan Kennedy and Anjali Shenoy]] presenting the [[https://research.google/pubs/pub36356/][Dapper]] paper. Our New York crew just happened to be in town for [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZdCLR02grLp__wRg5OTavVj4wefg69hM][Clojure West]] and got to attend that meetup. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cantrill][Bryan Cantrill]] and [[https://aphyr.com/posts/341-hexing-the-technical-interview][Kyle Kingsbury]] were there, along with other California luminaries of the time. For an art school kid from NYC, it was pretty mind blowing. 

Over the next few months local chapters of Papers We Love were popping up everywhere: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2Zz8UpQybw][London]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-wUbd8E6Wg][Toronto]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-mPW4tRrKw][Boston]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbuxMEtLYQQ][Madrid]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWYrrw7Zf1k][Raleigh-Durham]], [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGRqfvsPiRSgDs-CN65kWwqvM8Q165kum][Seattle]], [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGRqfvsPiRSg8pO_kimYih5ShMzLsJUMY][Los Angeles]], and [[https://paperswelove.org/chapter/][more]]. The idea of Papers We Love clearly scratched an itch, which I never would have imagined. 

* Babysteps to a conference

Momentum was growing, and occassionally folks would ask us if we were going to do a conference. After returning to Strange Loop in [[https://thestrangeloop.com/2014/sessions.html][2014]] and [[https://thestrangeloop.com/2015/sessions.html][2015]] we started working with the San Francisco crew on the possibility of making something real. Our first break was landing a small spot at [[https://youtu.be/-3tw2MYYT0Q][QCon in 2016]]. The organizers gave us a small room on their community night and we put together a program of four speakers: [[http://evelinag.com/about/][Evelina Gabasova]], [[https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/brewer.html][Eric Brewer]], [[https://www.oreilly.com/people/ines-sombra/][Ines Sombra]], and [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitie-mccaffrey-7831379b/][Caitie McCaffrey]].

It went well, and gave us an idea for a possible conference model. One of our biggest concerns was pulling power. As popular as the meetups were, they only drew 10 - 70 attendees depending on the location and speaker. We just weren't sure if the idea could pull in a few hundred people for a standalone conference. Attaching ourselves to a much larger event gave us a ready-made pool of attendees to draw from. We could survive as an [[https://www.thefreedictionary.com/epiphyte][epiphyte]], happily growing on the much larger branch of a conference like QCon, Velocity, or similar.

Our regular attendance at Strange Loop clued us into their Pre-Conference Program and we had attended the [[https://thestrangeloop.com/2013/sessions.html][Emerging Languages Conference]] in 2013 and [[https://thestrangeloop.com/2015/sessions.html][Future of Programming]] in 2015. These were programs setup the day *before* Strange Loop proper. The Pre-Conf Program always felt like a better home for us than the big industry conferences like [[https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/vl-ny.html][Velocity]]. Our backgrounds in art, film, music, literature, and computers seemed more in tune with the ethos at Strange Loop. Zeeshan approached [[https://github.com/puredanger][Alex Miller]] about making Papers We Love part of the official [[https://thestrangeloop.com/2016/pwlconf.html][Pre-Conference Program]], and to my surprise he went for it! 

/Note/: You can hear a more detailed history from Zeeshan and Alex in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loNeu5Yrazs][Episode 2]] of the Causal Islands Podcast.

[[https://pwlconf.org/2016/][Papers We Love Conf 2016]] shared the Pre-Conference Program with [[https://2016.elm-conf.us/][Elm Conf]] that year. It was our first go-around as conference organizers and we got lucky in that we had a *lot* of volunteers to help out. We also managed to land [[https://pwlconf.org/2016/sponsors/][sponsors]] which let us spend on sweet conference swag (t-shirts, custom badges, notebooks, stickers) and signage.

It was a crash course in logistics, having large boxes of shirts and notebooks delivered to the hotel. One of our signature moves was to have a box full of office supplies (Post-Its, rubber bands, sharpies, scissors, etc.) shipped in from Amazon as none of us were local. We spent the evening before alphabetizing badges and folding t-shirts. Making it up as you go along will get you surprisingly far.

Most importantly it worked. We pulled in about a couple of hundred people with a great program. Our speakers also had a good time, attending Strange Loop talks the following days and getting a taste of the community.
