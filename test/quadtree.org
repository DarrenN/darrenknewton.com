* Implementing Quadtrees in Racket

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree][Quadtrees]] are a common algorithm used in spatial indexing. They're handy when you want to quickly find nearest neighbors within a 2d space. I have a use case for them in a project that generates [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation][Delaunay triangles]].
